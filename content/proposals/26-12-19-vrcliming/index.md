## Inmersive game development for students 

We would like to create the following environment. **Students create the games that students play.**
This time we will create a VR Climbing demo. 
<!-- more -->

This forms a life cycle of learning and play. It is the starting point for game generation, where students learn to build immersive environments and design game competitions for their peers. In this way, we foster motivation and active engagement in the classroom.

## Immersive Climbing Game Project

This project features an **immersive climbing game** designed specifically for hosting **climbing championships among students**. Built in Godot with VR/XR support, it recreates realistic rock climbing walls, bouldering routes, and competitive formats where players grip holds, plan routes, and compete in real-time.

### Key Features
- **Realistic climbing mechanics**: Hand-tracking VR interactions with dynamic grip strength, foot placement, and fatigue simulation to mimic real climbing physics.
- **Modular climbing walls**: Procedurally generated or hand-crafted routes (beginner V0 to advanced V8 grades) that students can design and share.
- **Championship mode**: Tournament brackets with live leaderboards, spectator camera views, and timed ascents or flash/on-sight scoring.
- **Multiplayer & social**: Up to 8 players competing simultaneously, with classroom leaderboards and replay analysis for technique review.

### Educational Value
Students first **learn to develop** the climbing mechanics, route generation algorithms, and multiplayer networking. Then they **playtest and compete** using their creations, turning the classroom into a competitive arena. This closes the "create-play-share-compete" lifecycle, boosting engagement through ownership and friendly rivalry.

Perfect as a TFG project or extended practice module combining game design, physics simulation, VR UX, and competitive multiplayer systems.
